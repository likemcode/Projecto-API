## Installation

To run the Projecto API locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd projets`
3. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set up the database: `python manage.py migrate`
5. Start the development server: `python manage.py runserver`

The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Usage

To use the Projecto API, you can make HTTP requests to the provided endpoints using a tool like cURL or an API testing tool like Postman.

Before making requests, make sure to authenticate yourself and obtain an access token (see [Authentication](#authentication) section).

## Authentication

The Projecto API uses token-based authentication. To authenticate yourself and obtain an access token, follow these steps:

1. Send a POST request to `/api/token/` with your username and password in the request body.
2. If the credentials are valid, you will receive a response with an access token.
3. Include the access token in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests as `Bearer {access_token}`.

## Error Handling

The Projecto API follows standard HTTP status codes for indicating the success or failure of a request. In case of an error, the response will include an error message in the body.

Common error codes and their meanings:

- 400 Bad Request: The request was invalid or missing required parameters.
- 401 Unauthorized: The request requires authentication or the provided credentials are invalid.
- 403 Forbidden: The authenticated user does not have permission to access the requested resource.
- 404 Not Found: The requested resource was not found.
- 500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected error the server.
